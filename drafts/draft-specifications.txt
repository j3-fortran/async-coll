Subject: US04: Specifications for Asynchronous Collective Subroutines

Background
----------
Use case paper 23-174 "Asynchronous Tasks in Fortran" describes
"non-blocking collectives" that inspire the current requirements for what
we are now referring to as "asynchronous collective subroutines".  
  
Paper WG5/N2245 provides a rationale for asynchronous collective subroutines. 
  
The current Fortran 202Y work list WG5/N2249 includes asynchronous collective
subroutines as accepted work item US04.  
  
Paper J3/25-162 "US04: Requirements for Asynchronous Collective Subroutines"
presents an illustrative use case and a list of requirements.
  
The current paper provides specifications for the asynchronous collective 
subroutines feature.
